# Welcome to Anthroliz

This readme document is for the github repository. This will help as a reminder on how this task was built. 

Previously, we tried using [jekyllnow]() a jekyll template to build the website.

Now, we are going hardcore and building it from jekyll directly.  
You may call us hardcore, but we are taking this as an opportunity to learn a little bit about `ruby` as well.

Ruby is a web framework and jekyll is a framework that works directly with github pages. So that is nice.

### setup process

- set up github pages 
- clone the repository on local and create a branch
- check if ruby is installed. (mac catalina came with ruby >= 2.6) `ruby --version`
- install bundler on local path`gem install --user-install bundler` 
    - bundler helps create virtual environment where all package dependencies can be installed
- initialize bundler. This will create gemfile `bundle init`
- configure bundler to install gems in a project subdirectory ` bundle install --path vendor/bundle`
- add jekyll ` bundle add jekyll`
- bundle says add a jekyll scaffold, so lets do that `bundle exec jekyll new --force --skip-bundle .`
    - it created a few files such as `404.html`, `index.md`, etc
- now run `bundle install` as it was skipped earlier
- site is ready to serve. so lets get going ` bundle exec jekyll serve`

## cleanup

add lines to .gitignore. If gitignore doesn't exist, create a file with name .gitignore and paste the following

```
# Ignore metadata generated by Jekyll
_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata

# Ignore folders generated by Bundler
.bundle/
vendor/
```
