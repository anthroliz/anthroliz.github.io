I aim to help students achieve critical thinking and analytical skills that can be applied in their lives, no matter what major or career they pursue. I think students learn best when they are actively participating in the learning process; thus, I use strategies like flipped classrooms, metacognitive exercises, and student-led discussions to promote student involvement no matter the class size. I also believe in fostering diversity and inclusion in my classes, and I adapt my lessons and course materials to student interests and needs throughout the quarter based on real-time feedback I get in group discussions and one-on-one interactions with students.
