My research focuses on how and why individuals choose particular mates. I am especially interested in how parents and offspring navigate spouse choice decisions in cultures with arranged marriage, and how arranged marriages and love marriages differ in reproduction, health, and wellbeing. I use qualitative and quantitative data and borrow methods from a variety of disciplines in my research, including cross-cultural ethnographic comparison, analysis of large demographic surveys, cross-species comparison, focus group discussions, experiments from psychology, and primary fieldwork. I collect data on spouse choice, life-history, fertility, and child health in Dhading District, Nepal.
